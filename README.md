# Book-Search

## Description
This Application was refactored to use GraphQL and ApolloServer. The application is a Book search engine where the user can search any title when logged in or out. When logged in a user can save books and have them 
stored on a seperate page to look at later.
The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
